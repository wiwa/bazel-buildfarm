/**
 * @class DequeueMatchEvaluatorTest
 * @brief tests Algorithm for deciding whether a worker should keep a dequeued operation.
 * @details When a worker takes an entry off of the queue, should it decide to keep that entry or
 *     reject and requeue it? In some sense, it should keep all entries because they have already
 *     been vetted for that particular worker. This is because the scheduler matches operations to
 *     particular queues, and workers match themselves to which queues they want to read from. But
 *     should the worker always blindly take what it pops off? And can they trust the scheduler?
 *     There may be situations where the worker chooses to give operations back based on particular
 *     contexts not known to the scheduler. For example, you might have a variety of workers with
 *     different amounts of cpu cores all sharing the same queue. The queue may accept N-core
 *     operations, because N-core workers exist in the pool, but there are additionally some lower
 *     core workers that would need to forfeit running the operation. All the reasons a worker may
 *     decide it can't take on the operation and should give it back are implemented here. The
 *     settings provided allow varying amount of leniency when evaluating the platform properties.
